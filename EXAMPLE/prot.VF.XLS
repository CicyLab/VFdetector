This leads to water influx and vesicle swelling, and essential step in vacuole formation. By an as-yet-unidentified mechanism, the VacA toxin alters tight junctions and increases the paracellular route of permeability providing iron, nickel and other nutrients, this TER (trans-epithelial resistance) effect of VacA could be mediated through specific interaction with the recently identified cytosolic protein VIP54.; VacA is the first bacterial virulence factor that exploits the important plasma membrane sphingolipid, sphingomyelin (SM), as a cellular receptor."

VF0142	0.000000	Anthrax toxin	Toxin	Bacillus anthracis	"PA, EF and LF are secreted independently and assemble at the mammalian cell surface into toxin complexes. PA binds to cell-surface anthrax toxin receptor (ATR), encoded by the tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) gene. ATR is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular von Willebrand factor type A domain (VWA) and is cleaved by furin or a furin-like protease, releases an amino-terminal 20kDa fragment (PA20) and the receptor-bound carboxy-terminal 63kDa fragment (PA63). Recently, a second PA receptor encoded by capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2) has been identified. It has 60% amino acid identity to ATR/TEM8 within the VWA/I domain, as well as a conserved MIDAS (metal ion dependent adhesion site) motif; PA63 oligomerizes into ring-shaped hepameric or actameric pre-channels and binds 3 or 4 LF/EF substrates respectively. The assembled toxic complexes are then internalized by membrane lipid rafts and directed to endosomes. The PA oligomer transforms into a transmembrane, <beta>-barrel channel. The proton motive force unfolds and translocates LF and EF through the channel. Once the enzymatic moieties have accessed the cytosolic compartment, they exert their toxic activities."	"The combination of PA and EF is edema toxin (EdTx), the combination of PA and LF is lethal toxin (LeTx); EF is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that causes dramatic increases in intracellular concentrations of cAMP; LF is a zinc-dependent protease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) in their amino-terminal regions. It is a multi-functional virulence factor that appears to play a role in all stages of infection. Early in the infection, it acts to suppress immune cell and cytokine responses, thereby promoting bacterial outgrowth. Later in the disease, it induces the cytokine-independent shock-like death associated with anthrax."

It may form a pore in the eukaryotic membrane for the passage of other effectors; LidA (low viability in the presence of dot), a protein translocated to the phagosome membrane. It regulates Dot/Icm assembly and is thought to be one of the first translocated substrates. It is postulated to function in vesicle recruitment during the biogenesis of the replication vacuole; RalF, an exchange factor for the ADP ribosylation factor protein (ARF) family of GTPases. It is required for the localization of ARF on phagosomes containing L. pneumophila. ARF is important for biogenesis of the replicative organelle; DrrA (defect in Rab1 recruitment A, also known as SidM), is a multifunction enzyme with both GDF (GDI-displacement factor, GDI: guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) and GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) activities. DrrA has the intrinsic ability to bind to the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane. Because the L. pneumophila-containing vacuole (LCV is) initially a plasma-membrane-derived organelle, translocated DrrA protein associates with the immature LCV formed on bacterial internalization. The GDF activity of DrrA promotes the sampling of cytosolic Rab proteins associated with Rab GDI. When Rab1-Rab-GDI complexes are sampled, the removal of Rab GDI permits the GEF domain in DrrA to activate Rab1, leading to the stable association of Rab1 with the LCV membrane. Active Rab1 facilitates organization of the LCV membrane to promote the delivery and fusion of ER-derived vesicles. DrrA cycles off because the composition of the vacuole membrane changes.; LepB is a Rab1-specific GAP (GTPase-activating proteins). The LepB protein accumulates on the LCV membrane and the GAP activity facilitates the removal of Rab1 by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. The removal of Rab1 coincides with fusion of the LCV with the host ER and replication of L. pneumophila in a vacuole containing ER proteins.; Other candidate effector proteins including SidA-G (substrate of Dot/Icm transporter), Vips (VPS(vacuole protein sorting) inhibitor proteins, VipA, VipD, VipE, VipF), SdeA-D, YlfAB (yeast lethal factor A and B), their real function are unknown; Once the vacuole provides conditions for the bacteria to grow, functional genes of the dot/icm family become dispensable"	"Allows survival and growth in macrophages, prevent phagosome acidification and lysosome fusion, essential for induction of apoptosis in human macrophages"

Subsequently, wild-type Brucella is able to exclude these late endosomal/lysosomal markers from its vacuole and acquire markers of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Synaptotagmins I and II, two homologous synaptic vesicle proteins, have been shown to function in conjunction with gangliosides to mediate entry of BoNT/B into cells. Low-affinity interactions between BoNT/A and gangliosides have also been reported.

VopT shows approximately 45% and 44% identity with the ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) domain of ExoT and ExoS, respectively, which are two T3SS-secreted effectors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.;T3SS2 effector VopL encoding three Wiskott-Aldrich homology 2 (WH2) domains that are interspersed with three proline-rich motifs (PRM). VopL mimics a eukaryotic actin-nucleating protein by containing all of the necessary domains to enable it to potently and directly facilitate the assembly of actin. VopL mediated actin assembly occurs in a manner that is independent of any other eukaryotic factor.; VopA effector is a member of a family of type III effectors called YopJ-like proteins that are found in a wide variety of pathogens. YopJ was demonstrated to inhibit the MAPK and NF-<kappa>B signaling pathways by acetylating the critical serine and threonine residues found on the activation loop of MAPKkinases (MKKs), thereby blocking their activation by phosphorylation. VopA and YopJ share ~55% similarity at the amino acid level. VopA is also an acetyltranferase. VopA inhibits MAPK signaling using a novel mechanism. This effector acetylates a conserved lysine located in the catalytic loop of all kinases that plays a critical role in the binding of the <gamma>-phosphate of ATP. Modification of this lysine by acetylation inhibits the binding of ATP, but not ADP, to the MAPK kinase, resulting in an inactivate kinase."	T3SS2 is associated with enterotoxicity
